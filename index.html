  <p>This website is about math and how math helps you be a more openminded person. It helps you know that for math there are rules and that you always have a solution for it no matter what. Therefore, math helps you look at life in a brighter way, knowing you can solve it. Math is not only the same in every country but it is also, a way we live our everyday lives. Math is not only used at school, it is also used in everyday life,for example at the store when you are buying groceries or anything in general. You need math to know what your change will be and to know what you should or shouldn't be spending. Math is like an international language using numbers that everyone has the ability to learn and understand if they wanted to.
